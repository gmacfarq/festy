# Festy (Node Express Application)
- An application to generate custom Spotify playlists using music festival lineups
-  If you want to try it contact me directly for developer access (currently waiting on Spotify API approval for general use)

# Implemented
- Spotify web API connection using Open Source library (https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node)
- Designed in Figma and implemented in vanilla html/css/js
- Server-side rendering with nunjucks templating
- Store recent top tracks and festival data in database
- Store basic user data and associated playlists in database
- Deployed on AWS EC2 with RDS database

# TODO
- Style playlists page

- Support user reports of content errors
- Streamline festival content uploads
